            <br>
            <br>
            <ul>
                <li> 
                    <p>In computer science, a data structure is a way of organizing and storing data in a computer program so that it can be accessed and used 
                    efficiently. Data structures provide a means of managing large amounts of data, enabling efficient searching, sorting, insertion, and 
                    deletion of data.</p>
                </li>
                <li> 
                    <p>Data structures can be categorized into two types: primitive data structures and non-primitive data structures. Primitive data structures 
                    are the most basic data structures available in a programming language, such as integers, floating-point numbers, characters, and 
                    booleans. Non-primitive data structures are complex data structures that are built using primitive data types, such as arrays, 
                    linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, graphs, and hash tables.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                <p>The choice of data structure for a particular task depends on the type and amount of data to be processed, the operations that need 
                    to be performed on the data, and the efficiency requirements of the program. Efficient use of data structures can greatly improve the
                    performance of a program, making it faster and more memory-efficient. A data structure is a particular way of organizing data in a 
                    computer so that it can be used effectively. The idea is to reduce the space and time complexities of different tasks. </p>
                </li>
   
            </ul>
            
                <h5>Data structures are an essential concept in computer science and programming. Here are some reasons why they are important:</h5>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <p><strong>Efficient data processing: </strong>Data structures provide a way to organize and store data in a way that allows for efficient retrieval,
                        manipulation, and storage of data. For example, using a hash table to store data can provide constant-time access to data.<p>
                </li>
                 <li><strong>Memory management: </strong>Proper use of data structures can help to reduce memory usage and optimize the use of resources. For example, 
                     using dynamic arrays can allow for more efficient use of memory than using static arrays.</li>
                  <li><strong>Code reusability:</strong> Data structures can be used as building blocks in various algorithms and programs, making it easier to reuse 
                      code</li>
                   <li><strong>Abstraction:</strong> Data structures provide a level of abstraction that allows programmers to focus on the logical structure of the 
                       data and the operations that can be performed on it, rather than on the details of how the data is stored and manipulated.</li>
                   <li><strong>Algorithm design:</strong> Many algorithms rely on specific data structures to operate efficiently. 
                       Understanding data structures is crucial for designing and implementing efficient algorithms.</li>
                
            </ol>
